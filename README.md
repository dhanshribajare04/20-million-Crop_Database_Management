# 🌾20-million-Crop_Database_Management
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Crop Recommendation System that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions. It uses machine learning for prediction and provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user interaction.

The system takes various input parameters like:

🌡️ Temperature

💧 Humidity

🌱 Soil pH

☀️ Rainfall

🧪 Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK) levels

Based on these features, the model recommends the best crop for cultivation.

🚀 Features

📊 Machine learning-based crop prediction

🖥️ User-friendly GUI for input and result display

📂 Jupyter Notebook implementations (crop.ipynb and cropgui.ipynb)

🔮 Accurate prediction based on real dataset

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy → Data processing
